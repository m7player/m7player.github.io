### What is M7?
M7 is the future of multimedia playback and Miro, fixing many of the features that Miro has (and don't work anymore)  
Unlike Miro, M7 will (hopefully) be more supported unlike its predecessor, Miro.
### Why?
The project began in May 2022, with one of the core developers and designers for M7, [rand0mgh](https://github.com/rand0mgh) direct messaging CDL/Actinium about a Miro revival, several days later of planning and the following happened...  
* M7 finally got a logo
![m7 logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m7player/m7/master/tv/windows/icons/hicolor/128x128/apps/miro.png)
* and a Discord channel and server was created.
### What are those features?
- YouTube search
- Miro Guide
- The web browser (no longer renders some sites right)
### Where do I get M7?
